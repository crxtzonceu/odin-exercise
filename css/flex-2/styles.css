/* Note below the code */

.header  {
  font-family: monospace;
  background: papayawhip;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 8px;
}

  color: tomato;
  background: white;
  padding: 4px 32px;

ul {
  /* this removes the dots on the list items*/
  list-style-type: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  display: flex;
  gap: 10px;
}

a {
  font-size: 22px;
  background: white;
  padding: 8px;
  /* this removes the line under the links */
  text-decoration: none;
  /* margin-right: 10px; gap is better i think*/
}

/* This exercise is hard for me and im not confident on my answer so ill explained first what i did before i check the solution and correct this if i have such mistakes */

/* The code that i made isnt dry
- I made the header display flex and justify content to space between
- select the child div of the header to center vertically the ul's(align-items: center;)
- i set the ul margin and padding to 0
-  i set it to flex and put a gap so the items have a gap between them instead of putting margin-right
*/


/* After checking the solution
i just learned from my mistake that 
i can use the align items on the parent container and not selecting its child that have a child too. But i close to perfect tho. Its just that it isnt dry and can be more shorter and better */
